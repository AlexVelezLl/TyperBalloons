### Balloons Types
In **TyperBalloons** There are 3 types of baloons:
* Green Balloons: The green balloons contain inside an unique lower-case letter which you have to press to explode the balloon and collect that letter.
* Yellow Balloons: The yellow balloons contain inside an unique upper-case letter which you have to press to explode the balloon and collect that letter, we shall need to switch the caps lock to lead the game successfully.
* Red Balloons: The red balloons contain inside either two or three letters inside, which you need to press all the letters inside to explode the balloon and collect those letters.

#### Take care
There are a few demon balloons üòà which you need to avoid or you will lose all your collected letters.

### Considerations
Since the vocabulary in the game is Spanish, you would need to change your keyboard language because it can appear letters like "√±" in the balloons to form words with that letter, and if you do not have that letter on your keyboard, you won't be able to press that letter and therefore, explode the balloon.

In spanish there are few words with "tilde" like "est√°s", but in **TyperBalloons** the tildes are not considered, so you can feel free of that.
